## Project: Storefront

### Author: Brady Davenport

### Problem Domain

#### Phase 1: Setup (1 Aug 2022)

For this assignment, you will be starting the process of creating an e-Commerce storefront using React with Redux, coupled with your live API server

##### Phase 1 Feature Tasks

- Create a visually appealing site using `Material UI`
- Use a Redux Store to manage the state of categories and items in the store
- Display a list of categories from state
- When the user selects (clicks on) a category
  - Identify that category as selected (change of class/display)
  - Show a list of products associated with the category

#### Phase 2: Combine Reducers (2 Aug 2022)

Continue work on the e-Commerce storefront, breaking up the store into multiple reducers and sharing functionality/data between components

##### Phase 2 Feature Tasks

- Continue to use Material UI Components for layout and styling
- Add a “Cart” indicator to the header, like this: Cart (0)
- Create a new Cart component to show the items in the user’s cart

#### Phase 3: Redux - Asynchronous Actions (3 Aug 2022)

 Connect the Virtual Store to an API to retrieve live data from your data source, using thunk to enable asynchronous actions

##### Phase 3 Feature Tasks

- Continue to use Material UI Components for layout and styling
- Load the category and product list from a remote API on page load.
- Update the product quantity in stock when adding items to (or removing from) the cart
- Continue to use multiple reducers
